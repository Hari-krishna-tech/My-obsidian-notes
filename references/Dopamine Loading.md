- how Dopamine normally look for the person in a day 

## two types of stimulant for dopamine 
Artificial (sugar, junk food, social media, youtube, movie, pv etc)
natural (Learning , books, excercise, sex etc.. )

natural dopamine sources only provide little dopamine boost, while the artificial one provide very high 

the contrast in the energy is noticable, that the low dopamine stimulating things become very hard to do 

the Idea of Dopamine Loading it that you Ideal dopamine levels through the day should be below

# through out the day you should have low dopamine levels 
	- Steps to acheive that
	- await Artificial dopamine releasing agents in the morning time
	- So you should not check you phone , listen to high volume music, watch youtube or netflix, social media
	- You should only do the low dopamine stuffs like reading, exercise, bath, brush, learning , writting, don't watch youtube while eating 
	- in this way your brain will be motiviated to do this low dopamine tasks because it not see a lot of contrast 


## My personal use case 
 - Do Dsa, project, work
 - don't listen to music 
 - after 9-10 
 - after completing all the work , try to watch youtube, have junk food, or whatever you prefer 
 - I need to make sure most of the day i don't have lot of high dopamine inducing things
