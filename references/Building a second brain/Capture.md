Twelve Favorite problem : What to keep and what not to keep 

Feynman's word 

#### You have to keep a dozen of your favorite problems constantly present in your mind, although by and large they will lay in a dormant state. Every time you hear or read a new trick or a new result, test it against each of your twelve problems to see whether it helps. Every once in a while there will be a hit , and people will say, "How did he do it? He must be a genius!"

* Don't save entire chapters of a book, only the important part you want to remember 
* don't make memo of whole interview, only do it for the important part
