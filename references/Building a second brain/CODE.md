CODE : [[Capture]] , [[Organize]] , [[Distill]], and [[Express]]

Capture: Capture what resonates 
 - making every piece of info you came across does work, we need to mindfull of our choices 
Organize: Save of actionability

* While organization is important complex ways to organize the subject does work, we need to think simple , put all relative topic on a folder can most of the time good enough
Distill: Get out the essence 

* While making notes don't think like a note taker, instead think of a note consumer, if you make very detailed long notes, in future you not caring about that notes is going to happen for sure
* So make sure to get the essence only capture, don't do long one 
Express: Show what you learning 

* Knowledge without action is not very usefull, show the world what you are capable off
