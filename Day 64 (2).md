## Big Picture

imagine you have two sorted lists, like [1, 3, 5] and [2, 4, 6, 7]. If you merged them, you’d get [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], which has 7 elements. The median would be the 4th element (position 3 if we count from 0), which is 4. Our goal is to find this median efficiently, in a way that’s faster than merging the arrays, which would take time proportional to their total length. This code uses a clever trick called binary search to do it much faster, focusing on splitting the arrays into two halves.

  

## why make the first arrays smaller

Here, m is the length of nums1, and n is the length of nums2. The code swaps the arrays if nums1 is longer, ensuring nums1 is the smaller one (so m <= n). Why? Because we are doing binary search on that to minimize the time complexity

  

## what's the median position?

This medianPos tells us how many elements we want in the "left half" of the combined array. Let’s break it down:

  

Total length (m + n) is odd: Say m + n = 7. Then (7 + 1) / 2 = 4. We want 4 elements in the left half, and the median is the largest of those (e.g., in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], it’s 4).

  

Total length is even: Say m + n = 8. Then (8 + 1) / 2 = 4. We take 4 elements in the left half and 4 in the right half, and the median is the average of the largest in the left and the smallest in the right (e.g., in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], it’s (4 + 5) / 2 = 4.5).

  

The +1 helps us handle the odd case neatly, as we’ll see later.

  

## Splitting the Arrays

The idea is to split both arrays into a left part and a right part so that:

  

The total number of elements in the left parts equals medianPos.

  

All elements in the left parts are less than or equal to all elements in the right parts.

  

For example, with [1, 3, 5] (length 3) and [2, 4, 6, 7] (length 4), total length is 7, so medianPos = 4. We might split like:

  

nums1: [1, 3] (left) and [5] (right)

nums2: [2] (left) and [4, 6, 7] (right)

  

Left part: [1, 2, 3] (3 elements) plus one more to reach 4. We adjust until it works perfectly.

  

## Binary Search Magic

leftCut: Number of elements from nums1 in the left part (between 0 and m).

  

rightCut: Number from nums2, calculated as medianPos - leftCut, so leftCut + rightCut = medianPos.

  

We try different leftCut values, starting in the middle of possible values (0 to m), and adjust based on the result.

  

## Defining the Edges

left1: Last element in nums1’s left part (or very small if none taken).

left2: Last element in nums2’s left part.

right1: First element in nums1’s right part (or very big if all taken).

right2: First element in nums2’s right part.

  

Using MIN_VALUE and MAX_VALUE handles edge cases when we take nothing or everything from an array.

  

## Checking the Split

Odd total length: Median is the largest in the left half (max(left1, left2)).

Even total length: Average of the largest in the left (max(left1, left2)) and smallest in the right (min(right1, right2)).

  

left1 > right2: Took too many from nums1, so reduce leftCut.

Otherwise (implying left2 > right1): Took too few from nums1, so increase leftCut.

# Complexity

- Time complexity:

<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

$$O(log(m))$$

  

- Space complexity:

<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

$$O(1)$$

# Code

```java []

class Solution {

public double findMedianSortedArrays(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {

int m = nums1.length;

int n = nums2.length;

// first arr should be smaller

if(m > n) return findMedianSortedArrays(nums2, nums1);

  

int left = 0, right = m;

int medianPos = (m+n+1)/2; // help with odd number

// if m + n is 7 -> it will give 4

while(left <= right) {

  

int leftCut = left + (right - left)/2;

int rightCut = medianPos - leftCut;

  

int left1 = leftCut == 0? Integer.MIN_VALUE: nums1[leftCut - 1];

int left2 = rightCut == 0? Integer.MIN_VALUE: nums2[rightCut - 1];

int right1 = leftCut >= m ? Integer.MAX_VALUE : nums1[leftCut];

int right2 = rightCut >= n ? Integer.MAX_VALUE : nums2[rightCut];

  

if(left1 <= right2 && left2 <= right1) {

// arrays is splited in a way that

// all the element in the left are smallar than all the element on that right

// keep medians pos value in mind

// as leftCut + rightCut == medianPos

  

// if odd values

if((m+n)%2 != 0) {

return (double) Math.max(left1, left2);

} else {

  

return ((double) Math.max(left1, left2) + (double) Math.min(right1, right2))/2;

}

}

  

if(left1 > right2) {

right = leftCut - 1;

} else {

left = leftCut + 1;

}

}

  

return 0.0;

}

}
