# Intuition

<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->


  tag: [[DSA]], [[binary search tree]], [[tree map]]
  

use a tree map to store the schedules, so that we can retrive the records efficiently

  

in order make sure that the current interval is not colliding with other

  

we need greatest start that is lesser than us

and smallest start that is greater than us

  

in the lesser start's end is greater than our start, then we are collding with that we can return false

  

other wise the if the greater start is less than oru end then we are colliding them so return the false

  

otherwise just add and schedule and return true

  

# Complexity

- Time complexity:

<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

$$O(logn)$$ -> due to the use of treeMap

  

- Space complexity:

<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

$$O(n)$$ -> we are stroing all the schedules

  

# Code

```java []

class MyCalendar {

TreeMap<Integer, Integer> treeMap;

public MyCalendar() {

this.treeMap = new TreeMap<>();

}

  

public boolean book(int startTime, int endTime) {

  

// find the largest start less than me (logn)

Integer prev = treeMap.floorKey(startTime);

// find the largest start greater than me (logN)

Integer next = treeMap.ceilingKey(startTime);

  

// if we found the largest start that is else than or equal to us, then it's end should be lesser than us also inorder not to collide

// if the next start the is smallest number greater than our start, then it's end should not collide with our end

if(prev != null && treeMap.get(prev) > startTime || next != null && next < endTime) {

return false;

}

  
  

treeMap.put(startTime, endTime);

return true;

}

}

  

/**

* Your MyCalendar object will be instantiated and called as such:

* MyCalendar obj = new MyCalendar();

* boolean param_1 = obj.book(startTime,endTime);
