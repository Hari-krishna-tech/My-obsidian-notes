Tag: [[DSA]], [[recursion]]


traverse across the string

if digit is found

find the whole digit

find the string inside the top []

do a recursive decodeString on that

append it to number of time the digit say

  

if digit not found

just append the character

  

make sure to take care of indices so that you don't recompute things again

  
  

# Complexity

- Time complexity:

<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

$$O(M)$$ where M is the length of the decoded output string.

  

Each character in the decoded string is generated exactly once through appending operations. Even though the solution involves recursive processing of nested substrings, each level of recursion processes its substring linearly. The scanning of brackets and digits contributes linearly to the input size, which is dominated by the output size M in cases with nested expansions.

  

- Space complexity:

<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

$$O(D + M)$$ where D is the maximum depth of recursion (nesting level) and M is the length of the decoded string.

  

Recursion Stack: The recursion depth D corresponds to the maximum nesting level of brackets in the input, which can be up to $$O(n)$$ where n is the input length.

  

Output Storage: The space required to store the intermediate and final decoded strings is $$O(M)$$, as each character in the output is stored once.

int i = 0;

  

while(i < n) {

// check if cur ch is a digit

if(isDigit(ch)) {

// need to process

int num = 0;

while(i < n && s.charAt(i) != '[') {

num = num * 10 + s.charAt(i)-'0';

i++;

}

  

// i will be at the start of the [

String internalString = internalWord(s, i);

  

// internalString is computer so

i = i + internalString.length() + 2; // to offet last ] and move to next word

String internalDecoded = decodeString(internalString);

// append decoded string n times

for(int j = 0; j < num; j++) {

ans.append(internalDecoded);

}

} else {

// just append to ans

ans.append(ch);
