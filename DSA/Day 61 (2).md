# Intuition

<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->

when you find a increasing side, try to find your answer that way, there should be a answer (if i think hard enough you will get it )

# Complexity

- Time complexity:

<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

$$O(logn)$$

- Space complexity:

<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

$$O(1)$$

# Code

```java []

class Solution {

public int findPeakElement(int[] nums) {

int n = nums.length;

int left = 0, right = n-1;

  

while (left < right) {

int mid1 = left + (right - left)/2;

int mid2 = mid1 + 1;

  

if(nums[mid1] > nums[mid2]) {

right = mid1;

} else {

left = mid2;

}

  

}

  

return left;

}

}
