# Intuition

<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->

Do a binary search, still you find smallest element greater than or equal to the target

Tag : [[DSA]], [[binary search]]

  

# Complexity

- Time complexity:

<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

$$O(logn)$$

  

- Space complexity:

<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

$$O(1)$$

  

# Code

```java []

class Solution {

public int searchInsert(int[] nums, int target) {

// find the index of first number greater than target

  

int n = nums.length;

  

int left = 0, right = n- 1;

  

while(left <= right) {

int mid = left + (right - left)/2;

  

if(nums[mid] < target) {

left = mid + 1;

} else {

right = mid - 1;

}

}

  

return left;

}

}
