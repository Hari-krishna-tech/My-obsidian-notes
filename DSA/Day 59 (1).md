This is a classic "Dutch National Flag" problem. The array contains only three possible values: 0, 1, and 2.

The goal is to sort the array in-place without using extra space.

  
  

# Approach

<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->

We use three pointers:

- `start` to keep track of the boundary for 0s.

- `end` to keep track of the boundary for 2s.

- `i` to traverse the array.

- We iterate through the array while `i <= end`:

- If `nums[i] == 0`, swap with `nums[start]` and move both `i` and `start` forward.

- If `nums[i] == 2`, swap with `nums[end]` and move `end` backward (but `i` remains the same until we verify the swapped element).

- If `nums[i] == 1`, just move `i` forward.

  
  

# Complexity

- Time complexity:

<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

$$O(n)$$ because each element is processed at most once.

- Space complexity:

<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

$$O(1)$$ since we are not using any additional data structures.

  

# Code

```java []

class Solution {

  

public void swap(int[] nums, int i, int j) {

int temp = nums[i];

  

nums[i] = nums[j];

nums[j] = temp;

}

public void sortColors(int[] nums) {

int n = nums.length;

  

int start = 0, end = nums.length - 1;

  

int i = 0;

while( i <= end) {

if(nums[i] == 0) {

swap(nums, i++, start++);

} else if(nums[i] == 2) {

  

swap(nums, i, end--);

} else {

i++;

}

}

}

}
