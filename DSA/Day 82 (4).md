tag: [[DSA]], [[post order traversal]]

This is a tricky problem, so just divide it into part's to understand it better. 

Just think of only the base case, 
that is the leaf node, where you can have access to the parent 

your value should be 1, if you have more than that or less than that we have a problem 

so for the more than case, will push that many element to the parent (becase be don't have other option)
for less than case we pull that many from the parent 
we add to the answer how many we are pushing and full 
and at the end make yourself 1


now that's base case 

when you are not a leaf, then you can evenly distribute in left first with you as parent, and in the first with you as parent (Post order traversal)

now you know let and right are evenly distribution, if you can excess value you need to push it to your parent, 
and count it in your answer
