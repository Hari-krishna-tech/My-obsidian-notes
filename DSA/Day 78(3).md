Tag: [[DSA]], [[in order traversal]], [[morris traversal]]  

maintain a current element

  

if left is empty just return current val and make current to right

  

if left is not empty

  

now we need to move on to the left most node, as we are not saving any node before moving down , we try to find the inorder predecessor (right most node of left sub tree) and make it's right current

  

in this when we find a node that inorder predecessor is mark right we know the left is already marked hence we are moving right of current

  
  
  

# Complexity

- Time complexity:

<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

$$O(1)$$

  

- Space complexity:

<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

$$O(1)$$ - morris traversal
