inorder to understand approach let's just take a example

  

1 3 6 9 2

  

prefix sum

  

1 4 10 19 21

  

select a random number between 0 and 20

  

find the index in prefix sum where

smaller number that is greater than or equal to targer

  

bigger number have bigger probability as that have lot of range between them

  
  
  
  

# Complexity

- Time complexity:

<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

$$O(logn)$$

  

- Space complexity:

<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

$$O(1)$$

  

# Code

```java []

class Solution {

private int[] prefix;

private int sum;

private Random rand;

public Solution(int[] w) {

int n = w.length;

// prefix sum is the probability of each number

// as the demoninator is same for all the number

this.prefix = new int[n];

this.prefix[0] = w[0];

for(int i = 1; i < n; i++) {

this.prefix[i] = this.prefix[i-1] + w[i];

}

  

this.sum = prefix[n-1];

  

rand = new Random();

}

public int pickIndex() {

// 1 to sum inclusive

int r = this.rand.nextInt(this.sum);

  
  

int left = 0, right = this.prefix.length- 1;

  

while( left < right) {

int mid = left + (right - left)/2;

  

if(this.prefix[mid] > r) {

right = mid;

} else {

left = mid + 1;

}

}

return left;

  
  

}

}
