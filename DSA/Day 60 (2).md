Tag: [[DSA]], [[binary search]]  

1. Find First Position (findFirstPosition method):

• Perform a binary search.

• When the target is found at mid, store mid in idx because it could be the first occurrence.

• But instead of stopping, move right = mid - 1 to continue searching on the left side to find an even earlier occurrence.

• Continue until no more occurrences are found, ensuring that the leftmost index of the target is returned.

2. Find Last Position (findLastPosition method):

• Similar approach, but this time when the target is found at mid, store mid and move left = mid + 1 to find a later occurrence on the right side.

• This ensures that the last occurrence is found after exploring all possibilities to the right.

  

# Complexity

- Time complexity:

<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

$$O(logn)$$

  

- Space complexity:

<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

$$O(1)$$

  

# Code

```java []

int mid = left + (right - left)/2;

  

if(nums[mid] == target) {

idx = mid;

right = mid - 1;

} else if (nums[mid] > target) {

right = mid - 1;

} else {

left = mid + 1;
