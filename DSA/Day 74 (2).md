This solution uses a clever approach with prefix sums to find all paths that sum to the target in a single traversal. Here's the key intuition:

Core Idea

If we have a path from node A to node B with a sum of curSum, and there was a previously seen prefix sum of curSum - targetSum, then the path from that previous point to node B must sum to exactly targetSum.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

  

## Prefix Sum Tracking:

  

We use a HashMap to keep track of all prefix sums we've seen so far along the current path.

The key is the prefix sum, and the value is the count of how many times we've seen that sum.

  
  

## Initial Setup:

  

We start with a prefix sum of 0 with count 1 in our map (representing an empty path).

  
  

## At each node:

  

We add the current node's value to our running sum.

We check if curSum - targetSum exists in our prefix sum map. If it does, we've found paths that sum to targetSum.

We increment the count for the current prefix sum in our map.

  
  

## Backtracking:

  

After processing a node and its subtrees, we decrement the count of the current prefix sum.

This is crucial because it ensures we only consider prefix sums that are on the current path from the root.

  
  

## Result Calculation:

  

For each node, we count:

  

Paths ending at the current node (from prefixMap.getOrDefault(curSum - targetSum, 0))

Paths in the left subtree (recursive call)

Paths in the right subtree (recursive call)

  
  
  
  
  

## Why This Works:

  

By tracking all prefix sums along the current path, we can find any subpath that sums to the target in O(1) time.

The backtracking step ensures we don't count paths that aren't valid (e.g., paths that go through unrelated branches).

  

# Complexity

- Time complexity:

<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

$$O(n)$$ - every node visited only once

  

- Space complexity:

<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

$$O(h)$$ - height of the tree

  

# Code

```java []

/**

* Definition for a binary tree node.

* public class TreeNode {

* int val;

* TreeNode left;

* TreeNode right;

* TreeNode() {}

* TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }

* TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {

* this.val = val;

* this.left = left;

* this.right = right;

* }

* }

class Solution {

public int pathSumUtil(TreeNode root, long curSum, int targetSum, HashMap<Long, Integer> prefixMap) {

if(root == null) {

return 0;

}

curSum += root.val;

int numOfPath = prefixMap.getOrDefault(curSum- targetSum, 0);

  

// put the current prefix sum in HashMap

prefixMap.put(curSum, prefixMap.getOrDefault(curSum, 0) + 1);

  

// calculate the result by recursing left and right sub tree

int result = numOfPath + pathSumUtil(root.left, curSum, targetSum, prefixMap) + pathSumUtil(root.right, curSum, targetSum, prefixMap);

  

// backtrack when left and right side of current tree is recursed , we remove our sum because if the control goes to left side, it should not see the right side

prefixMap.put(curSum, prefixMap.get(curSum) - 1);

  
  

return result;

}

public int pathSum(TreeNode root, int targetSum) {

  

HashMap<Long, Integer> prefixMap = new HashMap<>();

// initialize 1 for zero

prefixMap.put(0L, 1);

return pathSumUtil(root, 0, targetSum, prefixMap);

}

}
