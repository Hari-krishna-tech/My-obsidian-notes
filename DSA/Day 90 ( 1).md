Create a Map heap to store the effort (bricks need to go from one to next building)

  

start moving from 1 buidling to next

when effor is less than zero

just move on to next building

when it is greater

get it from the bricks

if the bricks goes negative, replace the maximum effort(bricks) taken before with a ladder and add that to the brick count

  

if the brick count goes negative and we have no ladders left, then we have to exist there

  

if we reach end return that index

  
  

# Complexity

- Time complexity:

<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

$$(NLogN)$$ -> insert in priorityQueue cost logn, at we do N insert

  

- Space complexity:

<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

$$O(n)$$ -> store effort in pq

# Code

```java []

  

class Solution {

public int furthestBuilding(int[] heights, int bricks, int ladders) {

PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>((p,q) -> (q) - (p));

  
  

// how far i can reach with brikns ans ladders

int start = 0;

int n = heights.length;

while(start < n-1) {

int effort = heights[start+1] - heights[start];

  

if(effort <= 0) {

start++;

continue;

}

  

bricks -= effort;

pq.add(effort);

System.out.println(bricks + " " + effort);

if(bricks < 0) {

bricks += (pq.poll());

System.out.println(bricks);

if(ladders > 0) {

ladders--;

} else {

return start;

}

}

start++;

}

return n-1;

}

}
