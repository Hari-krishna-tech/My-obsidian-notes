# Intuition

<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->

  Tag: [[DSA]], [[binary search]]
  

as the 2d matrix is sort row wise and column wise

  

we can treat it as the large sorted arrays

  

and find the row, col with some maths

  

# Complexity

- Time complexity:

<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

$$O(log(m*n))$$

- Space complexity:

<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

$$O(1)$$

# Code

```java []

class Solution {

public boolean searchMatrix(int[][] matrix, int target) {

int m = matrix.length;

int n = matrix[0].length;

  

int left = 0, right = m*n-1;

  
  

while(left <= right) {

int mid = left + (right - left)/2;

  

int row = mid/n;

int col = mid%n;

// System.out.println("row: " + row + " col:" + col);

if(matrix[row][col] == target) {

return true;

}

  
  

if(matrix[row][col] < target) {

left = mid + 1;

} else {

right = mid - 1;

}

}

  

return false;

}

}
