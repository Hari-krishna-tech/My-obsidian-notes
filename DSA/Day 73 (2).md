```java []

if(height(root.right) == h - 1) {

// that means left side is a complete binary tree

// it have 2^h - 1 nodes we are adding the root also so it is 2^h in total

// only worry about the right side now

ans += (1<<h);

root = root.right;

} else {

// right side is bottom level is fully filled

// left side bottom level is only filled partially

// so we only need to worry abut the left side right side have 2^(h-1) full tree

  

ans += (1 << (h-1));

  

root = root.left;

}

```

  

# Complexity

- Time complexity:

<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

$$O(logn* logn)$$ -> we are cutting the work space into half every time , also trying to find height

  

- Space complexity:

<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

$$O(1)$$ -> not using any extra space

# Code

```java []

/**

* Definition for a binary tree node.

* public class TreeNode {

* int val;

* TreeNode left;

* TreeNode right;

* TreeNode() {}

* TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {

* this.val = val;

* this.left = left;

* this.right = right;
