we store the overlaps in a arrays and intervals in a arrays,

  

if we see that the current interval is in the overlap the it is occuring 3 times then we return the false

  

# Complexity

- Time complexity:

<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

$$O(n^2)$$

  

- Space complexity:

<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

$$O(n)$$

  

# Code

```java []

class MyCalendarTwo {

ArrayList<int[]> intervals;

ArrayList<int[]> overlaps;

public MyCalendarTwo() {

intervals = new ArrayList<>();

overlaps = new ArrayList<>();

}

public boolean book(int startTime, int endTime) {

  

// check whether it is in overlap or not

  

for(int[] overlap : overlaps) {

// if start is less then end and end is greater than start, then it is overlaping

if(startTime < overlap[1] && endTime > overlap[0]) {

return false;

}

}

  
  

for(int[] interval: intervals) {

if(startTime < interval[1] && endTime > interval[0]) {

overlaps.add(new int[]{Math.max(startTime, interval[0]), Math.min(endTime, interval[1])});

}

}

  

intervals.add(new int[]{startTime, endTime});

  

return true;

}

}
