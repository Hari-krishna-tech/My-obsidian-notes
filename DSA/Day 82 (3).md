make cur as root

  

iterate till cur is not equal to null

  

if current.left is not null,

  

then we are making the left sub tree as right

but if we do that , we will do the right sub tree,

for that case, we are finding the right most node in the left substree, inorder predescessor

and make it right as cur's right

  

so when we parse the whole left sub tree we can reach the right one with out storing it in the stack

  

# Complexity

- Time complexity:

<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

$$O(n)$$

  

- Space complexity:

<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

$$O(1)$$
