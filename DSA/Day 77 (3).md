# Intuition

<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->

Tag: [[DSA]], [[in order traversal]], [[iterative]]


go to the left most element, and store the all the element you see in the stack,

at the end pop the lement and add to add

and go to right

  
  

repeat

  

# Complexity

- Time complexity:

<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

$$O(n)$$

- Space complexity:

<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

$$O(n)$$ -> in the worst case for the stack

# Code

```java []

/**

* Definition for a binary tree node.

* public class TreeNode {

* int val;

* TreeNode left;

* TreeNode right;

* TreeNode() {}

* TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }

* TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {

* this.val = val;

* this.left = left;

* this.right = right;

* }
