# Intuition 
### **Intuition**

1. **Problem Context:**  
    The code is trying to solve a word search problem: Given a grid of characters (the board) and a list of words, you need to check for each word—using a Depth First Search (DFS) backtracking approach—whether the word can be found on the board by sequentially adjacent (horizontally or vertically) characters.
    
2. **How DFS Works in This Code:**
    
    - **Starting Point for Each Word:**  
        For each word, the code iterates over every cell in the board. If the cell's character matches the first character of the word, it starts a DFS from that cell.
        
    - **DFS Routine:**  
        The function `dfs` is called with the current index in the word and the current coordinates (i, j) on the board. The boolean matrix `vis` ensures that a cell is not revisited in the current recursion path (to avoid cycles).
        
    - **Exploration:**  
        From the current cell, the DFS explores all four possible directions: up, down, left, and right. The arrays `dirX` and `dirY` encode these directional moves.
        
    - **Matching Next Character:**  
        For each direction, if the next cell is valid (within bounds and not already visited), the code checks if the character in that cell matches the next character in the word (word.charAt(curIndex + 1)word.charAt(curIndex + 1)). If it matches, the DFS continues from that cell.
        
    - **Backtracking:**  
        If a path does not lead to a solution, the function "backtracks" by marking the cell as unvisited and removing the chosen path, so that other possibilities can be explored.
        
    - **Completion:**  
        When the DFS reaches the last character in the word (i.e., curIndex==word.length()−1curIndex==word.length()−1), the search for that word is successful, and the function returns true.
        
3. **Why DFS and Backtracking:**  
    The DFS combined with backtracking is a natural choice for exploring all possible paths in a grid while obeying the constraint that cells cannot be reused in the same word path.


# Time complexity 
1. **Per-word Complexity:**  
    Let's denote:
    
    - mm as the number of rows,
    - nn as the number of columns,
    - LL as the length of a word.
    
    In the worst-case scenario, you might explore nearly every cell in the board from each starting point and at each character position, leading to a branching factor of up to 4 directions. However, since the same cell cannot be reused (thanks to the visvis array), the complete exploration of one word in the worst case is bounded by the number of board cells and the DFS depth.
    
    Worst-case DFS for a single word could be roughly approximated as:
    
    O(m×n×4L)O(m×n×4L)
    
    This is a loose upper bound, assuming that for every position you try all 4 directions at every level of the recursion. In practice, many branches terminate early due to mismatches or revisiting visited states.
    
2. **Total Complexity for All Words:**  
    If you have kk words, then the worst-case time complexity becomes:
    
    O(k×m×n×4L)O(k×m×n×4L)
    
    Here, LL can be different for different words. In many practical scenarios, LL is much smaller than mm or nn, and heuristics (or early mismatches) reduce the average runtime.
    
    
### **Space Complexity Analysis**

3. **Auxiliary Space for DFS:**
    
    - The recursion depth can go up to LL (the length of the word), so the space occupied by the recursion stack is O(L)O(L).
4. **Visited Matrix:**
    
    - The 2D visited matrix visvis has size m×nm×n, so its space complexity is O(m×n)O(m×n).
5. **Overall Space Complexity:**  
    Combining these, the overall space complexity is:
    
    O(m×n+L)O(m×n+L)
    
    Typically, m×nm×n is the dominating term.

        // check 4 directions for the next word
