Tag: [[MonotonicStack]]


we are trying to make a monotonic increasing stack from the front,  
every time we pop a element we make sure max size that can be done by it

for example:  
we are in ith position heights[i] < stack.peek();  
now we now every element between stack.peek() and heights[i] is greater than heights[i]  
so the right side how much we can calculate is sorted out  
for the left side we can just check the stack.peek() to know th next smaller element  
so area should be between leftSmaller and height[i] which  
i - leftSmaler - 1  
if leftsmaller is -1, then every element from 0 to i - 1, if i is zero index then i

in this way we can find the answer,  
in case of the ascending order array of final case we are looping till n instead of n-1

# Complexity

- Time complexity:

O(n)

- Space complexity:

(n)

# Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int largestRectangleArea(int[] heights) {
       int n = heights.length;
       int ans = 0;
       // monotonic decreasing stack
       // 1 2 3 4 4 
       // 4 3 2 1
       Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();

       for(int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            // we are doing this for a edge case if the array is already in a increasing order or final few element are in acending order 
           int height= i==n?0: heights[i];
           
           while(!stack.isEmpty() && heights[stack.peek()] > height ) {
              int index = stack.pop();
              int leftSmaller = !stack.isEmpty()? stack.peek(): -1;

              // if leftSmaller is -1, in this case everything in the left is smaller 
              if(leftSmaller == -1) {
                 // here we are taking 1 based indexing
                 ans = Math.max(ans, heights[index] * i );
              } else {
                // min till next smaller 
                ans = Math.max(ans, heights[index] * (i-leftSmaller- 1));
              } 
           } 
        


           stack.push(i);
       } 

       return ans;
    }
}
```
